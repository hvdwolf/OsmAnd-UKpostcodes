# OsmAnd-UKpostcodes
Tiny set of scripts to create UK-postcodes files for OsmAnd

Here area few scripts to create either:
- a POI postcode file for the United Kingdom, being England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
- or postcode address files per country.
 

Since early 2015 or so OsmAnd can work with addresses (housenumbers) without a street. This make it possible to use (to fake) the postcode as housenumber. That's exactly what has been done with the address files.
If you know that a postcode os somewhere in a city, you can select that city and all postcodes will appear. If you don't know the city, you can directly search for the postcode.
